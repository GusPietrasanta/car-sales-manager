# Car Sales Manager

## Overview
📋 This practice project is a mock WPF app developed using Visual Studio. It allows users to perform basic calculations and includes event handlers for various buttons. The app also performs error handling and input validation to ensure accurate results. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting vehicle details, calculating costs, and generating a summary.

## How It Works
🔧 The app uses C# code to handle user interactions and perform calculations. Here's a brief overview of the key steps:

1. User inputs the vehicle price and trade-in value.
2. The app validates the inputs, ensuring that the vehicle price is greater than 0 and the trade-in value is greater than or equal to 0.
3. If the inputs are valid, the app proceeds to calculate the sub-amount, GST amount, and final amount based on the provided values, including the calculation of warranty cost, optional extras cost, and insurance cost.
4. The calculated amounts, along with other customer details, are displayed in the summary text box.

The app leverages event handlers to handle button clicks and uses exception handling to catch and display any errors that may occur during input parsing or validation.
