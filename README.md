# Car Sales Manager

## ‚úèÔ∏è Overview
This practice project is a mock WPF customer management application built using C# and XAML. It allows users to perform basic calculations, manage customer records and perform various operations such as searching for customers, deleting customers, and managing vehicle makes. 
The app utilises event handlers to handle button clicks and incorporates error handling and input validation to catch and display any errors that may occur during input parsing or validation. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting vehicle and customer details, calculating costs, and generating a brief summary.

## üîß How It Works

### üìä Summary button
The app uses C# code to handle user interactions and perform calculations. Here's a brief overview of the key steps when clicking the "Summary" button:

1. User inputs the vehicle price and trade-in value.
2. The app validates the inputs, ensuring that the vehicle price is greater than 0 and the trade-in value is greater than or equal to 0.
3. If the inputs are valid, the app proceeds to calculate the sub-amount, GST amount, and final amount based on the provided values, including the calculation of warranty cost, optional extras cost, and insurance cost.
4. The calculated amounts, along with other customer details, are displayed in the summary text box.

## üöÄ Features

### Displaying All Customers
The "Display all Customers" button generates a summary of all customers' names and phone numbers. It iterates through the names and phone numbers lists, generating a string that will be displayed in the Summary Details Text Block.

### Search for Customers

The app provides a search functionality to find customers by name. It uses a sequential search algorithm to look for the name in the list of customer names. If the name is found, the corresponding phone number is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

### Delete Customer

Users can delete a customer from the records by entering the customer's name. The app performs a search for the name and if found, removes the customer from the list of names and phone numbers. It then updates the summary details and displays a confirmation message showing the deleted customer's name, phone number, and the new length of the list.

### Display All Vehicle Makes

This feature allows users to view all the available vehicle makes in the application. It retrieves the list of vehicle makes and displays them in alphabetical order in the summary details.

### Search for Vehicle Makes

Users can search for a specific vehicle make using the binary search algorithm. The app performs a binary search on the sorted list of vehicle makes and displays a message indicating whether the make was found or not. If found, it also shows the index of the make in the list.

### Insert Vehicle Make

Users can add a new vehicle make to the list. The app first checks if the make already exists using the binary search algorithm. If not found, the make is added to the list, and the list is sorted again. The updated list of vehicle makes is then displayed in the summary details. If the make already exists, an error message is shown.
